                 When quality tires weren't around, we strove to make the best. When people wanted to ride cruisers in the dirt,
                  we made the first production mountain bike. When roadies wanted to go faster, we doubled-down on carbon and built our own wind tunnel.
                 And when we saw kids struggling to focus in school, we started the Specialized Foundation to help them through cycling.</p>
                <p className="story-container__text--end">Specialized. Made for riders, by riders.</p>
